#PAS DEX
In this breakdown, we are building A Decentralised Exchange (DEX) Smart contract  For ERC20 Token and PAS token( Native Token for PassetHub)

#Requirements

Build an exchange that allows swapping PAS <> KAKS

DEX must charge a 1% fee on swaps

When user adds liquidity, they must be given an LP Token that represents their share of the pool

LP must be able to burn their LP tokens to receive back PAS and KAKS


#Setup
We are using hardhat for smart contracts deployments. <br/>.
[Use this link to follow the instructions on how to use hardhat with Passet hub.](https://github.com/polkadot-developers/hackathon-guide/blob/master/polkadot-hub-devs.md)

##Deployed Contracts.
The KAKS ERC 20 Token address on PasetHub is ```0x3d3212874efB3E770597716d72518c9649FBDAA6```
The Exchange Smart Contract address deployed on the Passet Hub is: ```0xD5Cdc282BE2e7762Ce9f13684B9430910a38357e```
